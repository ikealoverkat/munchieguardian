You're the Munchie Guardian, chosen to protect innocent cat-like creatures called munchies from evil demons. However, you seem to have an illness... your life force is constagntly decreasing, which means you have to suck the life force out of the very munchies you're required to protect. A horde of demons raid Munchieland, and you're tasked to save the day, but how much will you lose in this battle?
